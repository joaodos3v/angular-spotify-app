## ‚òï Default using AngularSpotifyApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.3.

- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
- Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
- Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
- Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
